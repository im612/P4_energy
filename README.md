# Prediction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions of a city
We aim to predict the amount CO2 emissions and total energy consumption of non-residential buildings in the city of Seattle. Our sources are the data declared in two previous years each for real estate units in the city area. These data include, for each property: the energy consumption, CO2 emissions and characteristics such as location, address, use, architecture, etc.
